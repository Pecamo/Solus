          "body_markdown": "&gt; ... the type of an array to objects is `T (&amp;) [N]` ...\r\n\r\nNo. The type of an array is `T[N]`. The type of `a` is `A[1]`. What you are describing is a *reference* to an array, and your original example involves passing a *pointer* to an array, which has type `A(*)[1]`. The other rule you are running into is that an array can decay into a pointer. In other words, an object of type `T[N]` can be implicitly converted to an object of type `T*`. \r\n\r\nIt&#39;s because of that implicit conversion that your second example fails. The relevant overloads are simply:\r\n\r\n    template &lt;typename T&gt; void func(T (&amp;)[1]); // (1)\r\n    template &lt;typename T&gt; void func(T* );      // (2)\r\n\r\nBoth overloads are viable. The first is an exact match, whereas the second involves an array-to-pointer conversion. But according to the table in [over.ics.rank], the way to determine which viable candidate is better involves selecting conversion sequences thusly:\r\n\r\n&gt;  - Standard conversion sequence `S1` is a better conversion sequence than standard conversion sequence  `S2` if\r\n&gt;    - `S1` is a proper subsequence of `S2` (comparing the conversion sequences in the canonical form  defined by 13.3.3.1.1, **excluding\r\n&gt; any Lvalue Transformation**; the identity conversion sequence is considered to be a subsequence of any non-identity conversion\r\n&gt; sequence) or, if not that,\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;    - the rank of `S1` is better than the rank of `S2`, or `S1` and `S2` have the same rank and are distinguishable by the rules in the paragraph below, or, if not that,\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;    - [..]\r\n\r\nThe array-to-pointer conversion is an lvalue transformation, so it&#39;s excluded from that bullet point. Thus, neither conversion sequence is considered better, so we have to move onto the other tiebreakers. Yet, both functions are templates, and neither is more specialized than the other. That&#39;s why it&#39;s ambiguous. "

From the following code I can tell that when you take the address of an array with the `&amp;` operator the function call resolves to the one with `T (*a) [1]` and the call is not ambiguous, but the when I change the code to the following\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n    using namespace std;\r\n    \r\n    class A {\r\n        void foo(){}\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    template &lt;typename T&gt;\r\n    void func(T (&amp;a) [1]) {cout &lt;&lt; &quot;In array type&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;}\r\n    template &lt;typename T&gt;\r\n    void func(T (*a) [1]) {cout &lt;&lt; &quot;In pointer to array type &quot; &lt;&lt; endl;}\r\n    template &lt;typename T&gt;\r\n    void func(T* a) {cout &lt;&lt; &quot;in pointer type&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;}\r\n    template &lt;typename T&gt;\r\n    void func(T** a) {cout &lt;&lt; &quot;In pointer pointer type&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;}\r\n    template &lt;typename T&gt;\r\n    void func(...) {}\r\n    \r\n    int foo(int a) {return 1;}\r\n    int foo1() {return 1;}\r\n    \r\n    int main() {\r\n        A a[1];\r\n        func&lt;A&gt;(a);  // &lt;-- CHANGE HERE  \r\n    \r\n        return 0;\r\n    }\r\nI get an error, saying that the call to the function is ambiguous. So the imaginary `type_of(a)` and `T*` are equivalent. How then are the types of `&amp;a` and `T**` not equivalent?\r\n\r\nThe way I am trying to explain this to myself is that the type of an array to objects is `T (&amp;) [N]` and the type of an array of objects of type `T` is `T (*) [N]`. And that the standard allows implicit conversion from the first (i.e. from `T (&amp;a) [N]` to `T*`) but when you take the address of an array it does not implicitly go from a `T (*) [N]` to a `T**`. Am I correct? Or am I inferring what `T (*) [N]` is wrongly? \r\n\r\nFurther how do you go about reading the meaning of syntax like this. Is there a document I can refer to?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n",

          "body_markdown": "Unbounded arrays can be (and usually are) statically allocated.\r\n\r\nThe primary concern when implementing an unbounded array is to provide dynamic-array like freedom to decide the array size during run-time without the performance penalties of run-time memory allocation.\r\n\r\nThe following excerpt from an **[excellent article on unbounded arrays][1]** explains it succinctly -\r\n\r\n&gt;The general implementation strategy is as follows. We maintain an array of a fixed length **`limit`** and an internal index **`size`** which tracks how many elements are actually in the array. When we add a new element we increment **`size`**, when we remove an element we decrement **`size`**. The tricky issue is how to proceed when we are already at the **`limit`** and want to add another element. At that point, we allocate a new array with a larger **`limit`** and copy the elements we already have to the new array. \r\n\r\nNotice that during run-time, until `size` exceeds the initial value of `limit` there is no dynamic allocation involved with an unbounded array.\r\n\r\nSome **features** (design requirements) of an unbounded array :\r\n\r\n- Getting or setting the value at a particular index (constant time)\r\n- Iterating over the elements in order (linear time, good cache performance)\r\n- Inserting or deleting an element at the end of the array (constant amortized time)\r\n\r\n\r\nKeeping performance in mind, the only additional operations(compared to regular arrays) associated with unbounded arrays are :\r\n\r\n- `add_to_end()`\r\n- `delete_from_end()`\r\n\r\nto allow modifying the size of the unbounded array.\r\n\r\nOperations like `Insert_in_middle()` and `Delete_in_middle()` are NOT provided keep in mind the primary design principle of an unbounded array i.e. performance.\r\n\r\nFor more details, checkout the answers to this [question][2].\r\n\r\n&lt;sub&gt; NOTE : Though the question specifically mentions **dynamically allocated arrays**, probably you might also want to checkout [**dynamic arrays**][3]. A good example of a dynamic-array is the [`C++ std::vector`][4] itself which addresses several of the same design principles as that of an unbounded array.\r\n&lt;/sub&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fp/courses/15122-s11/lectures/12-ubarrays.pdf\r\n  [2]: https://stackoverflow.com/q/2710844/319204\r\n  [3]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_array\r\n  [4]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_%28C++%29"

The important point is that the code being passed the array, doesn&#39;t have to know how the array is bound and can take any array of a specific Type.\r\n\r\nSetting the bounds of an array is about allocating memory essentially. A function that uses the array, should hopefully only care that it doesn&#39;t reference memory that wasn&#39;t allocated to the array.\r\n"

          "body_markdown": "**ANSWER:** \r\n\r\nThe first thing that comes up when a conventional programmer thinks of an array (**in PHP**) would be something similar to:\r\n\r\n    \r\n    $myArray1 = array(2016, &quot;hello&quot;, 33);//option 1\r\n\r\n    $myArray2 = [2016, &quot;hello&quot;, 33];//option 2\r\n\r\n    $myArray3 = [];//option 3\r\n    $myArray3[] = 2016; \r\n    $myArray3[] = &quot;hello&quot;; \r\n    $myArray3[] = 33;\r\n\r\nWhere, if we wanted to call the array in some later part of the code, we could do:\r\n\r\n    echo $myArray1[1];// output: hello\r\n    echo $myArray2[1];// output: hello\r\n    echo $myArray3[1];// output: hello\r\n\r\nThe previous example showing the use of a **Sequential Array**\r\n(*since they increment the index used in a predetermined sequence, by incrementing by 1 for each following value*).\r\n\r\nSo far so good. However, as humans, we might find it hard to remember that index `[0]` of the array is the value of the **year** 2016, index `[1]` of the array is a **greetings**, and index `[2]` of the array is a simple **integer value**. The alternative we would then have is to use what is called an **Associative Array**. An Associative array has a few differences from a **Sequential Array**.\r\n\r\nDifferences (*between a sequential and associative array*):\r\n\r\n - Durring the declaration of an Associative Array, you don&#39;t only include the `value` of what you want to put in the array, but you also put the index value (called the `key`) which you want to use when calling the array in later parts of the code. The following syntax is used during it&#39;s declaration: `&quot;key&quot; =&gt; &quot;value&quot;`. \r\n\r\n - When using the Associative Array, the `key` value would then be placed inside the index of the array to retrieve the desired `value`.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor instance:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n        $myArray1 = array( \r\n            &quot;Year&quot; =&gt; 2016, \r\n            &quot;Greetings&quot; =&gt; &quot;hello&quot;, \r\n            &quot;Integer_value&quot; =&gt; 33);//option 1\r\n\r\n        $myArray2 = [ \r\n            &quot;Year&quot; =&gt;  2016, \r\n            &quot;Greetings&quot; =&gt; &quot;hello&quot;, \r\n            &quot;Integer_value&quot; =&gt; 33];//option 2\r\n\r\n        $myArray3 = [];//option 3\r\n        $myArray3[&quot;Year&quot;] = 2016; \r\n        $myArray3[&quot;Greetings&quot;] = &quot;hello&quot;; \r\n        $myArray3[&quot;Integer_value&quot;] = 33;\r\n\r\nAnd now, to receive the same output as before, the `key` value would be used in the arrays index:\r\n\r\n    echo $myArray1[&quot;Greetings&quot;];// output: hello\r\n    echo $myArray2[&quot;Greetings&quot;];// output: hello\r\n    echo $myArray3[&quot;Greetings&quot;];// output: hello\r\n\r\n"

          "body_markdown": "An array is an array and a pointer is a pointer, but in most cases array names are *converted* to pointers. A term often used is that they *decay* to pointers.\r\n\r\nHere is an array:\r\n\r\n    int a[7];\r\n\r\n`a` contains space for seven integers, and you can put a value in one of them with an assignment, like this:\r\n\r\n    a[3] = 9;\r\n\r\nHere is a pointer:\r\n\r\n    int *p;\r\n\r\n`p` doesn&#39;t contain any spaces for integers, but it can point to a space for an integer. We can, for example, set it to point to one of the places in the array `a`, such as the first one:\r\n\r\n    p = &amp;a[0];\r\n\r\nWhat can be confusing is that you can also write this:\r\n\r\n    p = a;\r\n\r\nThis does *not* copy the contents of the array `a` into the pointer `p` (whatever that would mean). Instead, the array name `a` is converted to a pointer to its first element. So that assignment does the same as the previous one.\r\n\r\nNow you can use `p` in a similar way to an array:\r\n\r\n    p[3] = 17;\r\n\r\nThe reason that this works is that the array dereferencing operator in C, `[ ]`, is defined in terms of pointers. `x[y]` means: start with the pointer `x`, step `y` elements forward after what the pointer points to, and then take whatever is there. Using pointer arithmetic syntax, `x[y]` can also be written as `*(x+y)`.\r\n\r\nFor this to work with a normal array, such as our `a`, the name `a` in `a[3]` must first be converted to a pointer (to the first element in `a`). Then we step 3 elements forward, and take whatever is there. In other words: take the element at position 3 in the array. (Which is the fourth element in the array, since the first one is numbered 0.)\r\n\r\nSo, in summary, array names in a C program are (in most cases) converted to pointers. One exception is when we use the `sizeof` operator on an array. If `a` was converted to a pointer in this context, `sizeof a` would give the size of a pointer and not of the actual array, which would be rather useless, so in that case `a` means the array itself."

          "body_markdown": "If an expression of array type (such as the array name) appears in a larger expression and it isn&#39;t the operand of either the `&amp;` or `sizeof` operators, then the type of the array expression is converted from &quot;N-element array of T&quot; to &quot;pointer to T&quot;, and the value of the expression is the address of the first element in the array.  \r\n\r\nIn short, the array name is not a pointer, but in most contexts it is treated *as though* it were a pointer.  \r\n\r\n**Edit**\r\n\r\nAnswering the question in the comment:\r\n\r\n&gt; If I use sizeof, do i count the size of only the elements of the array? Then the array “head” also takes up space with the information about length and a pointer (and this means that it takes more space, than a normal pointer would)?\r\n\r\nWhen you create an array, the only space that&#39;s allocated is the space for the elements themselves; no storage is materialized for a separate pointer or any metadata.  Given\r\n\r\n    char a[10];\r\n\r\nwhat you get in memory is\r\n\r\n       +---+\r\n    a: |   | a[0]\r\n       +---+ \r\n       |   | a[1]\r\n       +---+\r\n       |   | a[2]\r\n       +---+\r\n        ...\r\n       +---+\r\n       |   | a[9]\r\n       +---+\r\n\r\nThe *expression* `a` refers to the entire array, but there&#39;s no *object* `a` separate from the array elements themselves.  Thus, `sizeof a` gives you the size (in bytes) of the entire array.  The expression `&amp;a` gives you the address of the array, *which is the same as the address of the first element*.  The difference between `&amp;a` and `&amp;a[0]` is the type of the result&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; - `int (*)[10]` in the first case and `int *` in the second.  \r\n\r\nWhere things get weird is when you want to access individual elements - the expression `a[i]` is defined as the result of `*(a + i)` - given an address value `a`, offset `i` elements (*not bytes*) from that address and dereference the result.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that `a` isn&#39;t a pointer or an address - it&#39;s the entire array object.  Thus, the rule in C that whenever the compiler sees an expression of array type (such as `a`, which has type `char [10]`) *and* that expression isn&#39;t the operand of the `sizeof` or unary `&amp;` operators, the type of that expression is converted (&quot;decays&quot;) to a pointer type (`char *`), and the value of the expression is the address of the first element of the array.  Therefore, the *expression* `a` has the same type and value as the expression `&amp;a[0]` (and by extension, the expression `*a` has the same type and value as the expression `a[0]`).  \r\n\r\nC was derived from an earlier language called B, and in B `a` *was* a separate pointer object from the array elements `a[0]`, `a[1]`, etc.  Ritchie wanted to keep B&#39;s array semantics, but he didn&#39;t want to mess with storing the separate pointer object.  So he got rid of it.  Instead, the compiler will convert array expressions to pointer expressions during translation as necessary.  \r\n\r\nRemember that I said arrays don&#39;t store any metadata about their size.  As soon as that array expression &quot;decays&quot; to a pointer, all you have is a pointer to a single element.  That element may be the first of a sequence of elements, or it may be a single object.  There&#39;s no way to know based on the pointer itself.  \r\n\r\nWhen you pass an array expression to a function, all the function receives is a pointer to the first element - it has no idea how big the array is (this is why the `gets` function was such a menace and was eventually removed from the library).  For the function to know how many elements the array has, you must either use a sentinel value (such as the 0 terminator in C strings) or you must pass the number of elements as a separate parameter.  \r\n\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n&lt;sup&gt;\r\n&lt;ol&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Which *may* affect how the address value is interpreted - depends on the machine.\r\n&lt;/ol&gt;\r\n&lt;/sup&gt;"

          "body_markdown": "Indexes speed up select queries.  They make the difference between the database having to check every single row in a table for the results and knowing exactly where to go to find the information.  It&#39;s kind of the same concept as looping through a dictionary type data structure to find what you are looking for instead of just finding the value you want by it&#39;s key(index).  Indexes will slow down Inserts, updates and deletes though if you have too many because every alteration of the table will now have to create the indexes as well.\r\n\r\nA popular strategy in very very high volume/high performance applications is to have two databases.  One that is optimally indexed for fast retrievals and another that has very few indexes for fast inserts.  The only issue with this is, you lose real time data when the retrieval database has not synced yet with the insert database.\r\n\r\nThere are also two different kinds of indexes.  Clustered and non-clustered indexes.  If I&#39;m not mistaken, in MySQL primary keys are clustered and all other indexes are non clustered.  A good introduction article about the difference is [here][1].  It covers SQL Server, but the concept should be the same.\r\n\r\nI haven&#39;t worked much with MySQL but from what I can see online, FULLTEXT provides a way to search using a Natural Language full text search.  Basically, in the query, you will provide terms to search the full text indexed column(s) on and it will pull back all of the results.  Here are a few articles I found on the topic you might find useful.&lt;br /&gt;\r\n[MySQL Docs on Full Text Search][2]&lt;br /&gt;\r\n[Article 1][3]&lt;br /&gt;\r\n[Article 2][4]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://weblogs.sqlteam.com/mladenp/archive/2007/09/18/Back-To-Basics-What-is-a-Clustered-and-a-Non-Clustered.aspx\r\n  [2]: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/fulltext-search.html\r\n  [3]: http://www.databasejournal.com/features/mysql/article.php/1578331/Using-Fulltext-Indexes-in-MySQL---Part-1.htm\r\n  [4]: http://www.petefreitag.com/item/477.cfm"

It is better to limit you users for some fields i.e. *title* and *url*, since you have an index on url. And I don&#39;t think you can use index on columns that are of type `TEXT`. I don&#180;t think a `FULLTEXT`-index on *url* is what you want.\r\n\r\nI would recommend you to read up about databases in an introductory text or website."

The card may have detailed medical records etc. Your database may not keep these cards in order - maybe it just adds new folders to the end of the compactus. But it keeps a sorted &quot;index&quot; so that if you look up an SSN, it can tell you exactly where the relevant folder is kept.\r\n\r\nIn this example, the SSN is being used as a Primary Key. It&#39;s nice if it&#39;s unique, but even if it isn&#39;t unique, it can still speed things up."

Imagine you had a recipe book, and you wanted to find out how to make an omelet, you&#39;d simply skip to the back, find the word and its page number, and skip to that page number. Now imagine you had no index and had to search through 400 pages of recipes, what a nightmare!\r\n\r\nIndexes have several types Primary Key, Index, Unique, Fulltext\r\n\r\nPrimary Key is considered your main index, the first place mysql goes to find a record. Most people use an auto incrementing integer field for this since it&#39;s generally unique on each row.\r\n\r\nIndexes are considered your secondary primary keys, you place these on fields that you want to be able to search for quickly.\r\n\r\nUnique keys are similar to indexes however they work by ensuring that you cannot place duplicates in that column, eg you cant have the word &#39;eggs&#39; appear in the same column on two different rows.\r\n\r\nFinally Fulltext is a special index used by mysql&#39;s MyISAM storage engine only, it is used for searching your records using human phrases. without going into too much detail its mysqls own search engine, a more advanced version of the LIKE sql command.\r\n\r\nFor example if i searched for &#39;eggs and butter&#39;, fulltext would search for records containing eggs, butter, or both. where as LIKE would simply search for strings containing &#39;eggs and butter&#39;\r\n\r\nI hope this helps, the [mysql site][1] has plenty info on the subject, but this gives you the general gist of it.\r\n\r\nHappy coding :)\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/mysql-indexes.html"

          "body_markdown": "As stated elsewhere, ObjectMother is a Factory for generating Objects typically **(exclusively?)** for use in Unit Tests.\r\n\r\nWhere they are of great use is for generating complex objects where the data is of no particular significance to the test. \r\n\r\nWhere you might have created an empty instance below such as\r\n\r\n        Order rubishOrder = new Order(&quot;NoPropertiesSet&quot;);\r\n        _orderProcessor.Process(rubishOrder);\r\n\r\nyou would use a sensible one from the ObjectMother\r\n\r\n        Order motherOrder = ObjectMother.SimpleOrder();\r\n        _orderProcessor.Process(motherOrder);\r\n\r\nThis tends to help with situations where the class being tested starts to rely on a sensible object being passed in.  \r\n\r\nFor instance if you added some OrderNumber validation to the Order class above, you would simply need to instantiate the OrderNumber on the SimpleObject class in order for all the existing tests to pass, leaving you to concentrate on writing the validation tests.\r\n\r\nIf you had just instantiated the object in the test you would need to add it to every test (it is shocking how often I have seen people do this).  \r\n\r\nOf course this could just be extracted out to a method, but putting it in a separate class allows it to be shared between multiple test classes.  \r\n\r\nAnother recommended behaviour is to use good descriptive names for your methods, to promote reuse.  It is all to easy to end up with one object per test, which is definitely to be avoided.  It is better to generate objects that represent general rather than specific attributes and then customise for your test.  For instance ObjectMother.WealthyCustomer() rather than ObjectMother.CustomerWith1MdollarsSharesInBigPharmaAndDrivesAPorsche() and ObjectMother.CustomerWith1MdollarsSharesInBigPharmaAndDrivesAPorscheAndAFerrari()"

          "body_markdown": "In computing, an idempotent operation is one that has no additional effect if it is called more than once with the same input parameters. For example, removing an item from a set can be considered an idempotent operation on the set.\r\n\r\nIn mathematics, an idempotent operation is one where *f(f(x)) = f(x)*. For example, the `abs()` function is idempotent because `abs(abs(x)) = abs(x)` for all `x`. \r\n\r\nThese slightly different definitions can be reconciled by considering that *x* in the mathematical definition represents the state of an object, and *f* is an operation that may mutate that object. For example, consider the [Python `set`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#set) and its `discard` method. The `discard` method removes an element from a set, and does nothing if the element does not exist. So:\r\n\r\n    my_set.discard(x)\r\n\r\nhas exactly the same effect as doing the same operation twice:\r\n\r\n    my_set.discard(x)\r\n    my_set.discard(x)\r\n\r\nIdempotent operations are often used in the design of network protocols, where a request to perform an operation is guaranteed to happen at least once, but might also happen more than once. If the operation is idempotent, then there is no harm in performing the operation two or more times.\r\n\r\nSee the Wikipedia article on [idempotence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence) for more information.\r\n\r\n---\r\n&lt;sup&gt;The above answer previously had some incorrect and misleading examples. Comments below written before April 2014 refer to an older revision.&lt;/sup&gt;"

          "body_markdown": "An idempotent operation can be repeated an arbitrary number of times and the result will be the same as if it had been done only once.  In arithmetic, adding zero to a number is idempotent.\r\n\r\nIdempotence is talked about a lot in the context of &quot;RESTful&quot; web services.  REST seeks to maximally leverage HTTP to give programs access to web content, and is usually set in contrast to SOAP-based web services, which just tunnel remote procedure call style services inside HTTP requests and responses.\r\n\r\nREST organizes a web application into &quot;resources&quot; (like a Twitter user, or a Flickr image) and then uses the HTTP verbs of POST, PUT, GET, and DELETE to create, update, read, and delete those resources.\r\n\r\nIdempotence plays an important role in REST.  If you GET a representation of a REST resource (eg, GET a jpeg image from Flickr), and the operation fails, you can just repeat the GET again and again until the operation succeeds.  To the web service, it doesn&#39;t matter how many times the image is gotten.  Likewise, if you use a RESTful web service to update your Twitter account information, you can PUT the new information as many times as it takes in order to get confirmation from the web service.  PUT-ing it a thousand times is the same as PUT-ing it once.  Similarly DELETE-ing a REST resource a thousand times is the same as deleting it once.  Idempotence thus makes it a lot easier to construct a web service that&#39;s resilient to communication errors.\r\n\r\nFurther reading: [RESTful Web Services][1], by Richardson and Ruby (idempotence is discussed on page 103-104), and Roy Fielding&#39;s [PhD dissertation on REST][2].  Fielding was one of the authors of HTTP 1.1, RFC-2616, which talks about idempotence in [section 9.1.2][3].\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.amazon.com/RESTful-Web-Services-Leonard-Richardson/dp/0596529260\r\n  [2]: http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm\r\n  [3]: http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html"

          "body_markdown": "Idempotence means that applying an operation once or applying it multiple times has the same effect.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n - Multiplication by zero. No matter how many times you do it, the result is still zero.\r\n - Setting a boolean flag. No matter how many times you do it, the flag stays set.\r\n - Deleting a row from a database with a given ID. If you try it again, the row is still gone.\r\n\r\nFor **pure functions** (functions with no side effects) then idempotency implies that f(x) = f(f(x)) = f(f(f(x))) = f(f(f(f(x)))) = ...... for all values of x\r\n\r\nFor **functions with side effects**, idempotency furthermore implies that no additional side effects will be caused after the first application. You can consider the state of the world to be an additional &quot;hidden&quot; parameter to the function if you like.\r\n\r\nNote that in a world where you have concurrent actions going on, you may find that operations you thought were idempotent cease to be so (for example, another thread could unset the value of the boolean flag in the example above). Basically whenever you have concurrency and mutable state, you need to think much more carefully about idempotency.\r\n\r\nIdempotency is often a useful property in building robust systems. For example, if there is a risk that you may receive a duplicate message from a third party, it is helpful to have the message handler act as an idempotent operation so that the message effect only happens once."

          "body_markdown": "Just wanted to throw out a real use case that demonstrates idempotence. In JavaScript, say you are defining a bunch of model classes (as in MVC model). The way this is often implemented is functionally equivalent to something like this (basic example):\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: javascript --&gt;\r\n\r\n    function model(name) {\r\n      function Model() {\r\n        this.name = name;\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      return Model;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nYou could then define new classes like this:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    var User = model(&#39;user&#39;);\r\n    var Article = model(&#39;article&#39;);\r\n\r\nBut if you were to try to get the `User` class via `model(&#39;user&#39;)`, from somewhere else in the code, it would fail:\r\n\r\n    var User = model(&#39;user&#39;);\r\n    // ... then somewhere else in the code (in a different scope)\r\n    var User = model(&#39;user&#39;);\r\n\r\nThose two `User` constructors would be different. That is,\r\n\r\n    model(&#39;user&#39;) !== model(&#39;user&#39;);\r\n\r\nTo make it **idempotent**, you would just add some sort of caching mechanism, like this:\r\n\r\n    var collection = {};\r\n\r\n    function model(name) {\r\n      if (collection[name])\r\n        return collection[name];\r\n\r\n      function Model() {\r\n        this.name = name;\r\n      }\r\n      \r\n      collection[name] = Model;\r\n      return Model;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nBy adding caching, every time you did `model(&#39;user&#39;)` it will be the same object, and so it&#39;s idempotent. So:\r\n\r\n    model(&#39;user&#39;) === model(&#39;user&#39;);"

In very simplified PHP code, it&#39;s something like this:\r\n\r\n    class Array {\r\n    \r\n        private $data = [];\r\n        private $pointer = 0;\r\n    \r\n        public function key() {\r\n            return $this-&gt;data[$this-&gt;pointer][&#39;key&#39;];\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n    }\r\n\r\nYou do not have direct access to this array pointer from PHP code, you can just modify and influence it indirectly using PHP functions like `end`, `reset`, `each` etc. It is necessary for making those functions work; otherwise you couldn&#39;t iterate an array using `next()`, because where would it remember what the &quot;next&quot; entry is?"

          "body_markdown": "This is a simplistic answer, but an anonymous object is basically an object which the compiler creates a `class` for.  \r\n\r\nFor example in C# (I know this is kinda irrelevant) you can just create an anonymous type by doing:\r\n\r\n`new { filename = value }`.  \r\n\r\nThe compiler effectively creates a class called `AnonSomething1` [A random name you don&#39;t know] which has those fields.  Therefore at that point you just created an instance of that `AnonSomething1`.  C++ does not allow you to make anonymous class types inline (like Java and C# which have a base Object class which the anon types can derive).  \r\n\r\nHowever you can make an anonymous struct by simply writing \r\n\r\n    struct { \r\n        int field1; \r\n        std::string field2; \r\n    } myanonstruct; \r\n\r\nwhich creates an anonymous struct and instantiates it with the alias `myanonstruct`. This C++ code does not define a type, it just creates an anonymous one with 1 instance. \r\n\r\nSee C#: [Anon Types][1]\r\n\r\nSee Java: [Anon Types][2]\r\n\r\nSee C++ Structs: [msdn][3]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb397696.aspx\r\n  [2]: http://docstore.mik.ua/orelly/java-ent/jnut/ch03_12.htm\r\n  [3]: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/64973255%28v=vs.80%29.aspx"

They happen to have the same rules in this area (mostly), but it&#39;s important to keep in mind that they&#39;re two distinct (but closely related) languages.\r\n\r\nIt also depends on what you mean by &quot;an array&quot;. It&#39;s often best to think of the word &quot;array&quot; as an adjective, not a noun; thus you can have an array *type*, an array *object* (an object of array type), an array *expression* (an expression of array type), and so on.\r\n\r\nThe C and C++ standards do not define the phrase &quot;data type&quot;, though both standards do use the phrase informally a few times. Given the context, it&#39;s reasonably clear that the phrase &quot;data type&quot; is synonymous with &quot;object type&quot;.\r\n\r\nC has two kinds of types, object types and function types. (Prior to the C11 standard, incomplete types were a third kind; the definitions were changed in 2011 so incomplete types are a subset of object types.)\r\n\r\nAn array *type* is an object type (and no, this is not a matter of opinion).\r\n\r\nIf you&#39;ve been told that an array is &quot;really&quot; a pointer to its first element, you&#39;ve been badly misinformed. An array expression is implicitly *converted*, in most but not all contexts, to a pointer to the array&#39;s first element. The array object still exists, is still an object, and is still of array type.\r\n\r\nSuggested reading: Section 6 of the [comp.lang.c FAQ](http://www.c-faq.com/)."

So arrays *have type* rather than *are types*.\r\n\r\nWhile arrays have type (and are an example of container data structure), it is perhaps useful to understand that in C and C++, unlike fundamental types, and `class`/`struct`/`union` types they are not treated as [first-class data types][1] in that they cannot be passed as parameters by-value, returned by-value, or assigned to or from.\r\n\r\nAn array is not the same as a pointer - an array in C and C++ has *size* equal to the number of elements multiplied by the size of each element, whereas a pointer is the size of a pointer rather than the size of what it refers to.  However because an array is not a first-class type, when passed, returned or assigned-from, the array &quot;decays&quot; to a pointer.\r\n\r\nThe C++ STL supports various container data structure types that are more flexible and generally safer than raw arrays, and are first class types.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_citizen"
